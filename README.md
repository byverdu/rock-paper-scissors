## ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS
=======================

#### Task 1

Grab the code [from the repo](https://github.com/makersacademy/rockpaperscissors), and create a sinatra based web application that you can paly on your browser.

====


#### Task 2

Deploy the application to Heroku. Have two separate deployment targets: Stagging and Production.

So you will have two apps on Heroku that you will be deploying to and three git remotes **(origin, stagging production)**

The goal is to have two separate deployment targets running in the same environment and on the same platform. This way you cab deploy to stagging first and, if everything goes well, deploy to production later.

===========

#### Task 3

After deployed it to Heroku, add NewRelic add-on to the production environment on Heroku and find out the average page loading time using NewRelicÂ´s interface. Explore NewRelic to see what other analytical tools are available.

Write a little about what can be done with NewRelic in your own words and understanding.

==============

#### Bonus Level

Add some CSS to the app to make it beautiful.
